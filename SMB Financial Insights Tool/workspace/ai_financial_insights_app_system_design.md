# AI Financial Insights App - System Design

## Implementation Approach

Based on the requirements in the PRD, we need to design a scalable, secure, and maintainable architecture for the AI Financial Insights App. The application will enable SMBs to upload financial data, get automated dashboards, AI-powered insights, and interact with their financial data using natural language.

### Difficult Areas and Technical Challenges

1. **Data Security**: Financial data is sensitive and requires robust security measures.
2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Converting various file formats into a standardized structure.
3. **AI Integration**: Ensuring accurate and useful insights from LLMs.
4. **Real-time Dashboard Generation**: Creating responsive visualizations from potentially large datasets.
5. **Scalability**: Supporting multiple users with varying data sizes while maintaining performance.

### Technical Stack

1. **Frontend**: 
   - Streamlit for rapid dashboard development and user interface
   - Plotly for interactive data visualizations

2. **Backend**:
   - FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
   - Pydantic for data validation and parsing
   
3. **Data Processing**:
   - Pandas for data cleaning and transformation
   - DuckDB for in-memory SQL processing
   
4. **Authentication & Storage**:
   - Supabase for user authentication and data storage
   - PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for persistent storage
   
5. **AI Components**:
   - OpenAI API for natural language understanding and generation
   - LangChain for building AI-powered workflows
   
6. **Billing & Subscription**:
   - Stripe for payment processing and subscription management
   
7. **Deployment & DevOps**:
   - Docker for containerization
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) for hosting

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The application will consist of several key modules with well-defined interfaces. Below is a comprehensive class diagram detailing the core components.

   - JWT token management
   - Permission controls based on subscription tier

2. **File Processing Service**:
   - File validation and sanitization
   - Parsing Excel/CSV files with pandas
   - QuickBooks API integration
   - Data standardization and cleaning

3. **Data Storage Service**:
   - Storage of processed financial data
   - User data management
   - File metadata tracking

4. **Analytics Engine**:
   - Financial metrics calculation
   - Time-series processing
   - Aggregation and summarization

5. **AI Insight Service**:
   - Integration with OpenAI API
   - Text-to-SQL conversion
   - Anomaly detection
   - Recommendation generation

6. **Visualization Service**:
   - Chart generation based on data types
   - Text-to-visualization processing
   - Custom visualization templates

7. **Billing Service**:
   - Stripe integration
   - Subscription management
   - Usage tracking and limits

### Data Flow Process

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - User uploads financial data via Streamlit UI
   - Files are validated and temporarily stored
   - Data is parsed using pandas and standardized
   - Standardized data is stored in Supabase

2. **Dashboard Generation**:
   - User requests dashboard view
   - Backend retrieves stored financial data
   - Analytics engine calculates required metrics
   - Visualization service generates charts
   - UI displays interactive dashboard

3. **Natural Language Query**:
   - User enters a question about their data
   - Text is sent to AI Insight Service
   - Query is converted to SQL using LLMs
   - SQL is executed against DuckDB instance
   - Results are processed and formatted
   - Visualization is generated if applicable
   - Response is displayed to user

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - All data at rest is encrypted in Supabase storage
   - TLS for all API communications

2. **Authentication**:
   - Supabase JWT-based authentication
   - Token expiration and refresh policies
   - Secure password policies

3. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Subscription tier-based feature access
   - Row-level security in database

4. **Compliance**:
   - GDPR compliance for user data
   - Financial data handling best practices
   - Regular security audits

## Scalability Approach

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless API design for backend services
   - Load balancing across multiple instances

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Connection pooling
   - Read replicas for heavy query loads
   - Efficient indexing strategies

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis cache for frequent queries
   - Pre-computed aggregations for dashboards
   - Browser caching policies

## Monitoring and Maintenance

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Containerization**:
   - Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Compose files for local development

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated testing on pull requests
   - Staged deployments (dev, staging, production)
   - Blue/green deployment strategy

3. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Terraform/CloudFormation templates
   - Environment configuration management

## Anything Unclear

1. **Data Retention Policy**: The PRD mentions different retention periods for each tier, but we need to clarify the archival strategy and compliance requirements for financial data.

2. **Multi-tenancy Implementation**: We need to decide between a schema-per-tenant approach or a shared schema with tenant identifiers for the database architecture.

3. **AI Model Selection**: We should determine whether to use GPT-4, Mixtral, or other models for different AI features based on cost, performance, and accuracy requirements.

4. **Mobile Strategy**: While the PRD mentions mobile-responsive design as P2, we should clarify whether dedicated mobile apps are in the future roadmap.

5. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: We need to define detailed backup procedures, recovery time objectives (RTO), and recovery point objectives (RPO) for the application.
